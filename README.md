### Prerequisites

You will need the following to run this project:

- Node.js (v18 or newer).
- A PostgreSQL database.
- Docker.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/product-makers-hub/open-micro-saas.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd open-micro-saas
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`.

   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

4. Set up your Next auth secret. For more information, see [Next auth's documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#description-1).

   ```bash
   $ openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

5. Set up your database credentials in the `.env` file. Please notice that the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use the following credentials, feel free to use the values that makes sense to you:

   ```bash
   POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
   POSTGRES_PORT=6500
   POSTGRES_USER: your-user-that-you-want
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-password-that-you-want
   POSTGRES_DB: your-db-that-you-want
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your-user-that-you-want:your-password-that-you-want@localhost:6500/your-db-that-you-want?schema=public"
   ```

   Notice that the `DATABASE_URL` is the same as the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_PORT`, so make sure that you set the same values in all of them.

6. Compose the Docker image for the PostgreSQL database. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm run docker:compose
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server on port 3000.

### Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for integration testing.

For more information on how to write tests in Next.js with this tool, see [Next.js' documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/playwright).

The tests are located in the `tests` folder, and are a crucial part of the project. Please make sure that you write tests for any new feature that you add to the project.

You need a test database to run the tests. Follow the next stepts (first time only):

1. Create the test database in Docker:

```bash
npm run test:db:compose
```

2. Run the migrations. You have the database created, but you need to create the tables. For that, you need to run the migrations:

```bash
npm run test:db:prepare
```

3. Run the tests. You can now run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run the tests in the `tests` folder. You can also run the tests in UI mode with the following command:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

This will open a browser window where you can see the tests running.

Note: If you create a new migration in development, you need to run the migrations in the test database too.
